## Short story
It was a website that a friend of mine asked me to create for a magazine he was publishing. The magazine focused on our class. I thought it would be possible to access the magazine's latest news on the website, purchase the magazine, and subscribe to it. Subscriptions were lucrative, as you could receive free magazines and special offers for a whole month, for a small fee.
