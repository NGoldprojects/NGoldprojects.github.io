# HTEAM

This was one of my first websites. 

It was created in 2018, and it was my second website. The website was created for my CS:GO team.

::: info
"HTeam" was not the original name for the site. The original name of the site can be found on the [website](https://ngoldprojects.github.io/hteam/hteam.html) itself.

## Short story 
My friends and I have absolutely loved playing CS:GO in the past, especially on FACEIT. Before we even thought about starting a team (that was in 2018, I guess), I had a little bit of experience with website building (not great, I admit, but for someone just starting out, I think I did okay). Specifically, I made a website called ["SB"](/about/sb.md) (also known as "SedmoiBe" or "Seventh B" in English), and I took complete responsibility for it.

According to my idea, this website should have info about the team and its players (with links to their steam profiles and favorite games, and favorite CS:GO skin, among other things). Most of those ideas were implemented, and I made a one-page site for the upcoming [tournament](https://ngoldprojects.github.io/hteam/httournaments.html).

After the dissolution of our team in either 2019 or 2020, I decided to revive some of the website historical value by reviving this website as a nice memory.
